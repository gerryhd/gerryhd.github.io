            Hello! I'm Gerry, and I also go by Lion the Golden. I'm a software engineer student from Mexico.
            I really like programming and music.
            Welcome to <strong>lionsite</strong>, my personal website where I'll probably just upload stuff I'm working on and blog post sometimes.
            <strong>THIS IS A WIP WEBSITE!</strong> Nothing is final and I'm still working
            on all things design and stuff. This is really just my playground!
